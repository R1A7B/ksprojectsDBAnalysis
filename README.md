Hello,

This is my repository for my personal project on kickstarter data analysis. I took a csv file containing the data from 2018 kickstarter projects, and I added the data to a personal database and table to run SQL querries to do analysis and the success and failure of various kickstarter projects. Both the data and the jupyter notebook file I used to run my SQL querries were larger than the maximum file size for Github, so for now, I have uploaded the jupyter notebook and the data as zip files.
